## 📊 Merchant Onboarding & Installation MIS Automation for ME Ops Vendors 🚀

### Streamlining Vendor Performance Management with Automated MIS Reporting 📈 - Enhancing Visibility and Efficiency!

This project automated the manual process of consolidating, processing, and reporting on Merchant Onboarding and POS Machine Installation status from various vendors for YES Bank's ME (Merchant Ecosystem) Operations. The solution streamlines vendor performance management by providing automated, accurate, and timely MIS reports, enhancing visibility for internal stakeholders and improving communication with vendors.

### 🎯 Requirement: Manual, Time-Consuming Vendor Status Consolidation & Reporting

The existing process for managing vendor installation status was manual and inefficient:

*   **😓 Manual File Gathering from Emails:**  Operations team had to manually gather daily installation status files sent by various vendors via email.
*   **⏱️ Time-Consuming Data Massaging:**  Manually processing these vendor files, each with potentially different formats, and "massaging" the data to prepare MIS reports was a time-intensive task.
*   **⚠️ Error-Prone Data Filtering & MIS Creation:** Manually filtering data and creating MIS fields like aging and status in Excel was prone to errors and inconsistencies.
*   **📉 Lack of Timely Visibility:** Manual processing delayed the availability of consolidated MIS reports, hindering timely performance monitoring and decision-making.
*   **📤 Manual Report Distribution:**  Sharing MIS reports with internal stakeholders and vendors was a manual distribution process.

### 🤖 Automation Approach:  Centralized, Automated MIS Generation and Distribution

Our automation strategy focused on creating an automated MIS reporting system from vendor input files:

*   **📥 Automated Input File Retrieval from Shared Drive:** 🤖 Bot is designed to automatically pick up input files from a designated **shared drive location (K:\OSD-RPA-Files$)** where the Operations team saves vendor files received via email.
*   **✅ Data Checks and Filtering:** 🤖 Bot performs **predefined checks and filters** on the input files to identify eligible cases for MIS reporting, ensuring data quality and relevance.
*   **📊 MIS Field Calculation & Report Generation:** 🤖 Bot automatically calculates **aging, status, and other key MIS fields** based on the vendor data, eliminating manual calculations and ensuring consistent reporting.
*   **📤 Individual Vendor Working Files (Pivot Format):** 🤖 Bot generates **individual working files for each vendor in a Pivot Table format**, providing granular performance insights to the Operations team.
*   **📈 Consolidated MIS Report Generation:** 🤖 Bot consolidates data from all vendor files to create a **comprehensive consolidated MIS report**, offering a holistic view of vendor performance and installation status.
*   **📧 Automated Email Distribution of Reports:** 🤖 Bot automatically **emails individual vendor working files to designated users** and the **consolidated MIS report to relevant internal stakeholders**, ensuring timely and efficient information dissemination.
*   **📂 Output File Storage in Shared Drive:** 🤖 Bot saves both the **individual vendor working files and the consolidated MIS report** in a designated "Output" folder within the shared drive (K:\OSD-RPA-Files$\Output), creating a centralized repository for all MIS reports.

### ✨ Role of Automation:  Transforming Vendor MIS from Manual Effort to Automated Insights

Automation revolutionized the Vendor MIS process, enabling proactive performance management and data-driven insights:

*   **Automated MIS Generation:** 🤖 Bot automates the entire process of MIS report creation, from data intake to report distribution, removing manual effort.
*   **Improved Data Accuracy & Consistency:** 💯 Automated data processing and calculation eliminate manual errors, ensuring accurate, reliable, and consistent MIS reports.
*   **Timely MIS Reporting:** ⏱️ Automated process ensures timely generation and distribution of MIS reports, providing stakeholders with up-to-date insights for faster decision-making.
*   **Enhanced Visibility into Vendor Performance:** 📈 Individual vendor working files and consolidated MIS reports provide comprehensive visibility into vendor performance, enabling proactive management and issue identification.
*   **Streamlined Communication with Vendors:** 📧 Automated distribution of vendor-specific working files facilitates clear and efficient communication with vendor partners.
*   **Reduced Operational Overhead:** 🚀 Automation significantly reduces the manual workload on the Operations team, freeing up resources for more strategic vendor management activities.
